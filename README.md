# CFD-BenchLab

**A curated collection of benchmarking test cases with analytical solutions for the design, testing, comparison, and verification of numerical schemes.**

---

## Overview

CFD-BenchLab is a repository dedicated to providing rigorous test cases for verification and benchmarking of numerical schemes in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Each case includes analytical solutions, source terms, boundary conditions, and meshes. Scripts and tools are also provided when necessary to facilitate the reproducibility of results and the manipulation of the test cases.

This open laboratory aims to be a valuable resource for researchers, engineers, and students developing, testing, and comparing numerical schemes for fluid flow simulations.

## Objectives

- Collect benchmarking cases with known or manufactured analytical solutions.
- Enable quantitative verification through convergence and stability analysis.
- Provide an organised environment for comparative testing and benchmarking.
- Promote reproducibility and transparency in numerical schemes design.
- Offer educational material for teaching and training in numerical methods.
